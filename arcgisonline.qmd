#### Esri ArcGIS Online

ArcGIS Pro is an Esri cloud-based mapping and analysis interface. Increasingly ArcGIS Online is starting to include a wide range of analysis tools that have traditionally only been available in desktop software programs. This cloud-based GIS solution helps users understand geographic relationships and identify spatial patterns in their data. ArcGIS Online is an effective platform for GIS beginners as it is much more plug and play than traditional desktop software programs such as Esri's ArcGIS Pro. It maintains much of the functionality of traditional GIS software programs and allows users to answer geographic questions and communicate their findings through compelling digital maps and visualizations. Online maps produced in ArcGIS Online also serve as the foundation of other Esri online solutions including web apps, dashboards, and story maps.

ArcGIS Online works on most internet browsers and is available at no cost to University of Arizona faculty, staff, and students.
