#### R

R is a free and open-source programming language and software environment that is one of the most widely used tools in data science, research, and statistical analysis. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an organized works pace for writing code, exploring data creating visualizations, and managing projects. R is becoming increasingly popular for geospatial analysis and other GIS related tasks and includes a number of packages developed specifically for spatial data analysis. R can work with the most popular spatial data types and offers the ability to combine spatial analysis with advanced statistical modeling.

R and RStudio works on Windows, Mac, and Linux is available at no cost to anyone.
