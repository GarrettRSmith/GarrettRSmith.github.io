    "text": "QGIS\nQGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) is a free, open-source desktop application for creating, editing, visualizing, and analyzing geospatial data. QGIS provides GIS functionality that is comparable to commercial alternatives. QGIS can be used to perform spatial analysis and create visually appealing maps. QGIS has an extensive set of freely available plugins developed by a community of QGIS users. QGIS serves as an excellent learning platform for understanding fundamental GIS concepts due to the fact that it is free to download.\nQGIS works on Windows, Mac, and Linux is available at no cost to anyone.\nBelow you will find a number of basic tutorials related to QGIS that are meant to serve as a quick start guide to using the software. Please note that tutorials one and two are meant to be completed in a sequence.\nTutorial 0: Downloading QGIS\nVector Data\nTutorial 1: Opening QGIS and Starting a Project\nTutorial 2: Data Wrangling\nTutorial 3: Creating a Basic Map\nRaster Data\nTutorial 4: Basics of Raster Data"

    "text": "Esri ArcGIS Online\nArcGIS Pro is an Esri cloud-based mapping and analysis interface. Increasingly ArcGIS Online is starting to include a wide range of analysis tools that have traditionally only been available in desktop software programs. This cloud-based GIS solution helps users understand geographic relationships and identify spatial patterns in their data. ArcGIS Online is an effective platform for GIS beginners as it is much more plug and play than traditional desktop software programs such as Esri’s ArcGIS Pro. It maintains much of the functionality of traditional GIS software programs and allows users to answer geographic questions and communicate their findings through compelling digital maps and visualizations. Online maps produced in ArcGIS Online also serve as the foundation of other Esri online solutions including web apps, dashboards, and story maps.\nArcGIS Online works on most internet browsers and is available at no cost to University of Arizona faculty, staff, and students.\nBelow you will find a number of basic tutorials related to ArcGIS Online that are meant to serve as a quick start guide to using the software. Please note that tutorials one, two, and three are meant to be completed in a sequence.\nTutorial 0: Logging Into ArcGIS Online\nVector Data\nTutorial 1: Starting a Project\nTutorial 2: Data Wrangling\nTutorial 3: Creating a Basic Map\nSurvey123\nTutorial 4: Creating a Survey Using Survey123"

    "text": "R\nR is a free and open-source programming language and software environment that is one of the most widely used tools in data science, research, and statistical analysis. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an organized works pace for writing code, exploring data creating visualizations, and managing projects. R is becoming increasingly popular for geospatial analysis and other GIS related tasks and includes a number of packages developed specifically for spatial data analysis. R can work with the most popular spatial data types and offers the ability to combine spatial analysis with advanced statistical modeling.\nR and RStudio works on Windows, Mac, and Linux is available at no cost to anyone.\nHaving a basic understanding of R would prove helpful in completing these tutorials.
